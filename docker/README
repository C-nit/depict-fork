Build
=====

To build the 'cdk/depict' container copy the JAR file built with MAVEN 
to the directory with the Docker file.

	$ cp ../target/cdkdepict*.jar cdkdepict.jar
	$ docker build -t cdk/depict -f Dockerfile .

Alternatively run the 'build.sh' script.

	$ ./build.sh

Run
===

The web service is exposed through port 8080. To expose locally on port 8180 we
run the following command.

	docker run -it -p 8180:8080 cdk/depict

Note that when using docker-machine (e.g. VirtualBox) you will need to forward
the host/guest port there as well.
