Build from source
=====
To build the 'cdk/depict' image directly from source (including the MAVEN build)

	$ docker build -t cdkdepict -f Dockerfile .


Build from a local jar
=====

To build the 'cdk/depict' image, copy the JAR file built with MAVEN 
to the directory with the Docker file.

	$ cp ../cdkdepict-webapp/target/cdkdepict*.war cdkdepict.war
	$ docker build -t cdkdepict -f Dockerfile_dev .

Alternatively run the 'build.sh' script.

	$ ./build.sh

Run
===

The web service is exposed through port 8080. To expose locally on port 8180 we
run the following command.

	docker run -it -p 8180:8080 cdkdepict

Note that when using docker-machine (e.g. VirtualBox) you will need to forward
the host/guest port there as well.
